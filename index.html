                    <p>FY2019 marks our 20th anniversary, and we’d like to open this report with a big THANK YOU to the entire Ohana. It’s been a wild ride, and we’d never have made it this far without you.</p>
                    <p>When we started this company, we had a tiny office (that’s it at the bottom of the page) and a huge vision: to work for more than just the bottom line, and to drive change in the world around us. Together, we’ve worked hard to turn that vision into a reality, and, even more importantly, we’ve encouraged others to do the same.</p>
                    <p>As you read this over, we hope you’ll take some time to reflect on the incredible company we’ve built together, and the difference we’ve made for our customers and our communities.</p>
                    <p>Mahalo.</p>
